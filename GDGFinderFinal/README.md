Solution code for Kotlin Android Fundamentals 10.3: Design for everyone

[https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-design-for-everyone/#0]

To make an app usable by the most users makes sense, whether you are developing for the joy of it,
or for business purposes. There are multiple dimensions to accomplishing that.

 - Support RTL Languages. European and many other languages read from left to right, and apps
 originating from those locales are commonly designed to fit well for those languages. Many other
 languages with a large number of speakers read from right to left, such as Arabic. Make your app
  work with right-to-left (RTL) languages to increase your potential audience.

 - Scan for accessibility. Guessing at how someone else may experience your app is an option with
 pitfalls. The Accessibility Scanner app takes the guess work out of the loop and analyses your
 app, identifying where you could improve its accessibility.
 
 - Design for TalkBack with content descriptions. Visual impairments are more common than one might
 think, and many users, not just blind ones, use a screen reader. Content descriptions are phrases
 for a screen reader to say when a user interacts with an element of the screen.
 
 - Support night mode. For many visually impaired users, changing the screen colors improves
 contrast and helps them visually work with your app. Android makes it straightforward to support
 night mode, and you should always support night mode to give users a simple alternative to the
 default screen colors.

In this codelab, you explore each of these options and add support for it to the GDG Finder app.

You also learn how to use chips with your Android app. You can use chips to make your app more
interesting, while keeping it accessible.
